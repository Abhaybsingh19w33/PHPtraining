<p style="font-size:200%";>Hi and welcome back to our <em>week two </em>lessons.<br> 
<strong>You </strong>may remember from earlier that we created a template like the one we're looking at here to use as a basis for our future HTML files. So I've taken this template, and I've saved it as html2.html and made a few changes, calling it My Second Page and experimenting with Links and Text.</p>

<table border="1" style="border:solid" >
<tr>
<td>Day 1</td><td>walking</td><td>30 minutes</td>
</tr>
</table>
